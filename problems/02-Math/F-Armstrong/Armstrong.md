A positive integer is called an Armstrong number (of order n) if

abcd... = an + bn + cn + dn + ...
In the case of an Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because

153 = 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3
Similarly, 1634 is an Armstrong number because:

1634 = 1*1*1*1 + 6*6*6*6* + 3*3*3*3 + 4*4*4*4
